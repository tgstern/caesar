# Caesar

Program to encrypt a message with a Caesar cipher by Unix command line, written in C. Caesar encryption
shifts each character of a plaintext message through the alphabet by a constant value, wrapping around the
end of the alphabet. Requires <cs50.h> header file.

Once compiled, excute with syntax:
```
./caesar x
```
Where x is an integer to apply an amount of shift to the message.

User is then prompted for a plaintext message to encrypt, and program prints the encrypted message.
